## The Repository

meant as an example for BakkesMod plugins with Dear ImGui windows. However, you can still contribute to this project through bug reports and pull requests.

Rocket Plugins allows you to join any locally hosted game by direct IP, host games on any map including [workshop maps](https://steamcommunity.com/app/252950/workshop/) with support for limited and custom game modes and manipulating hosted games through a plethora of configurable settings.  
Rocket Plugins also includes a few experimental ways of automatically making your game reachable from outside of your network, including port forwarding through UPnP and UDP hole punching, based on the [original NAT characterization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN#Original_NAT_characterization_algorithm).
