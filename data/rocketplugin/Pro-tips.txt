Birb Tip - The bakkesmod also known as miniature bakkes (Bakkes Modicus) is a birb that is a member of its own branch of the cockatoo family endemic to Australia. They are prized as household pets and companion parrots throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed. As a caged birb, bakkes are second in popularity only to the budgerigar.\nThe bakkesmod is the only member of the genus Bakkes. It was previously considered a crested parrot or small bakkes; however, more recent molecular studies have assigned it to its own subfamily, Bakkes. It is, therefore, now classified as the smallest of the Cacatuidae (cockatoo family). Bakkes are native to Australia and favor the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bushlands.\nAdditionally, the bakkes can be identified easily when it is accompanied by its mutualistic companion, the spoon carrying alpaca. The alpaca often has a spoon in its possession whose size is far too large compared to it but refuses to let it go for sentimental reasons or so we're told.\nThe nests of bakkes birb are often seen littered with concrete blocks with two holes for aerodynamics. Scientists are unsure of where these come from since bakkes has no opposable thumbs or toes capable of picking up the objects. Some conspiracy theorists think it may be similar to the Death Valley 'Sailing Stones' situation, but the more rational thinkers believe aliens simply drop off their construction overage during the night. {Birb}

Grocery Tip - I saw halfwaydead at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person,\nbut I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.\n\nHe said, "Oh, like you're doing now?"\n\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?"\nand closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.\nWhen I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like "Sir, you need to pay for those first."\nAt first, he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually\n"to prevent any electrical interference," and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word.\nAfter she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly. {Bakbak}

Beany Tip - There once was a bean named MDK. He wasnâ€™t your average everyday bean but a plump bean, the plumpest of all the beans. One day he was sitting on the beaner and he beaned himself a little too hard and became a garbanzo bean. His parents disowned him and he lost all of his friends, he was then excommunicated out of his local bean community and was forced to live in the bean fields many beanometers away from the nearest living bean. After many cold nights alone surviving on nothing but sunlight suddenly, a giant bean-shaped bean came crashing down from the sky and out came the legendary group...the galactic garbanzo beans. A ruthless anti-bully squad that travels around the galaxy fighting all bean related crimes. The leader, bakkes, asked if he wanted to join. MDK gratefully joined the beans because no one else would accept him. The group would continue to travel around the galaxy and bean their hearts out. {ItsBranK}
